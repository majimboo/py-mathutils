# Py-Mathutils

Overview
========

This module originated from Blender (the opens-source 3d package),
where it has been used for some years in production as a utility module for use in areas including animation,
games and mesh manipulation.

This differs from ``numpy`` in that it is computer graphics focused,
combining Matrix and Vector types with rotation classes which is very useful
for use with animation or anywhere ``Euler`` and ``Quaternion`` values are used frequently.

This project is mainly a build system around the actively maintained ``mathutils`` code in
Blender to allow non Blender related projects to make use of it.

A link to the Blender repository is used so the source never gets out of sync.

``mathutils`` at a glance
=========================

- ``mathutils`` module, with classes: ``Matrix``, ``Vector``, ``Quaternion``, ``Euler`` and ``Color``.
- ``mathutils.geometry`` module for useful functions such as
  ``intersect_ray_tri``, ``intersect_line_line`` and ``area_tri``.
- Supports operations you'd expect, slicing, multiplication, comparison, division addition where applicable.
- Supports swizzle style access on vectors: `v.xyz, v.zy, v.xxyz...` etc.

Important Details
=================

    - Python 3 only
    - Written in portable C
    - Extensible...
      | mathutils types can be sub-classed from python.
      | C/C++ code can have mathutils objects synchronize with internal data using callbacks, or wrap the data directly.
    - Documentation here
      | http://www.blender.org/documentation/blender_python_api_current/mathutils.html
    - GPLv2 or later since this is apart of the Blender project.

Installing
==========
